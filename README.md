# Storyline 

## General Assembly WDI Project 2

### Introduction

The brief for this project was to create a full-stack  web app using RESTful resources and authentication. It was required that the app be build using NodeJS and Express with a Mongo database and a Mongoose ORM on the back end and AngularJS as the front end framework. 


### About the project
Our second GA WDI module introduced us to the concepts of MVC design patterns, RESTful routing with Express.js, the Angular framework, Node.js for server-side JavaScript, and NoSQL with MongoDB. At the end of this module we built our first MEAN stack application. I chose to build an application for my book club, called ‘Storyline’, which is a reading resource and repository that allows users to add books, share comments about the books and make reading suggestions. Again, this was a site I had wanted to build for some time as a tool share with my friends and other book lovers. 

A hosted version of the app can be found [here] (https://limitless-waters-27769.herokuapp.com/) and the code for the game can be found [here] (https://github.com/MarMinsk/Storyline).

#### Technical requirements for the project

* At least two models - one representing users and the other for the main app resource
* Relationships (embedded or referenced)
* Authentication - with encrypted passwords
* RESTful routes
* SCSS
* Wireframes
* Semantically clean HTML
* Deployed online

I used Balsamiq for the basic wireframes for the project. Although the final site didn't look quite like my original wireframes, this was very useful exercise to help in setting the framework for the project and gave me some useful structure for how the site would look.

#### Credit
My development of this project was assisted greatly by the support and guidance of GA Instructors, Rane Gowan and Alex Chin and Teaching Assistant, Natalie Huitson.

I also received a great amount of assistance from my book club friends in sourcing books we'd read over the years to use as my seed data for the Mongo database.
